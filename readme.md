## Weavy WebView properties
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|`Uri` | The uri that the WebView should display|
| `AuthenticationToken` | A JWT authentication token to enable SSO. For more information, please check out the [Weavy Docs](https://www.weavy.com/docs/v8/client/authentication) |
| `CanGoBack`  |If the WebView can go back in history  |
| `CanGoForward` | If the WebView can go forward in history |

## Weavy WebView methods
| Method | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Load(string uri = null, string authenticationToken = null)` | Load and display the Uri in the WebView. Optionally pass in  uri and authenticationToken. Otherwise these will be read from the properties `Uri` and `AuthenticationToken` |
| `Reload()` | Reload the current url in the WebView |
| `GoBack()` | Go back one step in page history |
| `GoForward()` | Go forward one step in page history |
| `GetUser(Action<string> callback)` | Get the current logged in user. A json string of the user is returned to the callback |
| `RegisterCallback(string name, Action<string> callback)` | Register a custom callback with a specific name and the callback that should be called from javascript |
| `InjectJavaScript(string script)`  | Inject a custom javascript to the WebView. If you want to call a callback that you have registered (check out method above) you shoud call this in the script like this `Native('myCallbackName', myArgs)` |


## Weavy WebView events
| Event | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `InitCompleted` | When the WebView is initiated and ready to load a uri. Listen to this event before Loading the `Uri` using `Load()` |
| `Loading` | The Weavy WebView is loading the requested `Uri` |
| `LoadFinished` | The Weavy WebView has finished loading the `Uri` |
| `LoadError` | An error occurred when loading the `Uri` |
| `SSOError` | If `AuthenticationToken` is specified and an error occurred when using the token, this event will be triggered. |
| `BadgeUpdated` | The Weavy badge is updated. Either a new message or a new notification. You can get the badge values from the `BadgeEventArgs` parameter. |
| `Theming` | The Weavy web site has a theme. This will be retured on each request and triggers the Theming event. You can get the themeing values from the `ThemingEventArgs` parameter. |
| `LinkClicked` | An external link has been clicked in the Weavy WebView. If you want to open extrnal links in the mobile web browser, you can listen for this event and call `Launcher.OpenAsync(new Uri(args.Url));` in Xamarin.Forms. The url can be read from the `LinkEventArgs`. |
| `SignedOut` | Triggered when the user signs out from Weavy. |


## Using SSO

If you are using this plugin in an existing app you have most certainly already an authentication flow for the users. Weavy uses JWT to enable a SSO flow between the host app and the Weavy integration. You can read more about how JWT works with Weavy in the [Weavy Docs](https://www.weavy.com/docs/v8/client/authentication). 

When you have generated the JWT according to the specs in the Docs, you can pass this to a Weavy WebView and the user will automatically be signed in.

```C#
var weavyWebView = new WeavyWebView{
    Uri = "https://myweavy.weavycloud.com/e/apps/10",
    AuthenticationToken = myGeneratedJWT
};

weavyWebView.InitCompleted += (s, a) => { weavyWebView.Load(); };
```
Figure 4. *Add a Weavy WebView with an AuthenticationToken.*

## Example
```C#
public class MyPage: ContentPage {

    public MyPage(){
        
        // create new WebView and generate a new JWT token (See section Using SSO above)
        var weavyWebView = new WeavyWebView{
            Uri = "https://myweavy.weavycloud.com/e/apps/10",
            AuthenticationToken = GenerateJWT() 
        };

        // make sure to init webview before doing the Load
        weavyWebView.InitCompleted += (s, a) => { weavyWebView.Load(); };

        // web view has finished loading page
        weavyWebView.LoadFinished += (sender, args) =>
        {
            // example of getting current logged in user
            weavyWebView.GetUser((jsonData) => {
                var user = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<User>(jsonData);                    
            });
        };

        // an external link was clicked in the web view
        weavyWebView.LinkClicked += (sender, linkArgs) =>
        {  
            // open link in mobile browser
            Launcher.OpenAsync(linkArgs.Url);
        };

        // listen to badge updated event
        weavyWebView.BadgeUpdated += (sender, badgeArgs) =>
        {
            var unreadConversations = badgeArgs.Conversations;
            var unreadNotifications = badgeArgs.Notifications;

            // update app badge or do something else with the badge data...
        };

    }

}
```
